# Mobile Azure Samples

## Summary

This repository continas samples on how to access **Azure Cosmos DB** and **Azure Storage**  services with React Native and Ionic Framework.

## Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB is a database for building blazing fast, planet scale applications with native support for NoSQL. It was built from the ground up with global distribution and horizontal scale at its core. It offers turnkey global distribution across any number of Azure regions by transparently scaling and replicating your data wherever your users are. Elastically scale your writes and reads all around the globe, and pay only for what you need. Azure Cosmos DB provides native support for NoSQL and OSS APIs including MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin and SQL, offers multiple well-defined consistency models, guarantees single-digit-millisecond read and write latencies at the 99th percentile, and guarantees 99.999 high availability with multi-homing anywhere in the worldâ€”all backed by industry-leading, comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs).
